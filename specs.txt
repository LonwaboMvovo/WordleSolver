- needs to solve wordle
- wordle is 5 letter game
- user stars out with 6 tries
- all letters originally = grey
- if letter is guessed in the correct spot = green
- if letter is guessed in the word but in the wrong spot = yellow
- if letter is guess and not in the word then word blacked out = black

- start out with a all letters possibly being in the word (keep in mind duplicates exist)
- can start out with the best word = SALET (not AUDIO Bill Gates you muppet)
- if a letter is not in the word we make it black
- search for 5 letter words that satisfy the remaining letters
- keep removing words that don't satisfy until word is guessed correctly or game is lost

- check if letters in correct place first
- check if letter in word and not in a place that has letter correctly guessed
- if letter neither then remove it from valid letters and add to invalid letters
- remove words that contain invalid letters
- remove words that don't have correctly guessed letters in the correct position

- maybe has a twitter/slack and each day tweets result we'll see
